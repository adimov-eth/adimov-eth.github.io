    <h1>TON Stars: Tiered Referral System and Leaderboards</h1>

    <h2>Tiered Referral System</h2>
    <p>A tiered referral system can incentivize users to bring in more players and reward them for their continued efforts. Here's how it could work:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bronze Tier (1-5 referrals):</strong> Basic rewards, such as a small Quark bonus for each referral.</li>
        <li><strong>Silver Tier (6-15 referrals):</strong> Increased Quark rewards and a small Star bonus for each referral.</li>
        <li><strong>Gold Tier (16-30 referrals):</strong> Higher Quark and Star rewards, plus a special boost or in-game item.</li>
        <li><strong>Platinum Tier (31-50 referrals):</strong> Substantial rewards, exclusive items, and a small percentage of the referred players' earnings for a limited time.</li>
        <li><strong>Diamond Tier (51+ referrals):</strong> All previous rewards plus entry into exclusive events, higher voting power in community decisions, and a permanent small percentage of referred players' earnings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This system encourages continuous referral activity and rewards the most active community builders.</p>

    <h2>Importance of Leaderboards</h2>
    <p>Leaderboards are important for several reasons:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Competitive Motivation:</strong> They tap into players' competitive nature, encouraging them to play more to climb the rankings.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Proof:</strong> Top players on leaderboards serve as aspirational figures for others, showcasing what's possible in the game.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Players often discuss leaderboard rankings, creating more community interaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Goal Setting:</strong> Leaderboards provide clear, visible goals for players to strive towards.</li>
        <li><strong>Retention:</strong> The desire to maintain or improve one's ranking can keep players coming back regularly.</li>
        <li><strong>Prestige:</strong> Being on top of a leaderboard can be a source of pride and status within the game community.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Types of Leaderboards to Consider</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Daily/Weekly/Monthly Quark earnings</li>
        <li>Total Star holdings</li>
        <li>Most missions completed</li>
        <li>Highest level achieved</li>
        <li>Most referrals</li>
    </ul>
