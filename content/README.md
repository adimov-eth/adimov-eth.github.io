## Questions Needing Research

**Current traction (validate with Tan):**
- [ ] Actual monthly package volume & revenue
- [ ] Customer acquisition channels working now
- [ ] Confirmed vs prospective aggregator/course partnerships
- [ ] GolfOkay.co metrics (traffic, conversion, bookings)

**Missing context:**
- [ ] How does Tan currently operate? (baseline to automate)
- [ ] Which specific courses are API-ready vs manual?
- [ ] CAC (customer acquisition cost) estimates
- [ ] Pricing strategy beyond "15% commission standard"
- [ ] Course relationship templates (what rates, terms, exclusivity?)
- [ ] Revenue share models for partnerships

**Risk scenarios:**
- [ ] What if aggregators raise fees?
- [ ] What if courses integrate APIs faster than expected?
- [ ] What if PromptPay fees increase?
- [ ] What if TAT regulations change?
