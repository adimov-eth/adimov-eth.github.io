## Part 1: Market Opportunity

### Validated Data (2024-2025)

**Market size:**
- 700K golf tourists annually (TAT, AGIF)
- ~฿100K spend per trip (3× average tourist) - *historical 2011 estimate*
- ~300 golf courses (150-200 international standard)

**Distribution reality:**
- Majority of bookings via agents (phone/LINE/email)
- Only a minority of courses have modern APIs
- Fragmented, manual workflows dominate

**Digital infrastructure:**
- PromptPay: 81M users, 0.8-1.5% fees vs 3%+ cards
- Digital wallets: 22% of POS transactions
- Visa expansion: 93 countries, 60-day stays

### Competitor Weakness

**Incumbents:**
- Club Thailand Card: 15K members, 200+ courses, legacy UX, no mobile app
- Golfasian: 192K customers, email/phone only, no self-service
- GolfNow: Global platform, weak local penetration
- Major OTAs: List golf resorts but no dedicated tee-time vertical

**Digital gaps:**
- No unified platform (booking + transport + accommodation)
- No price transparency or dynamic pricing
- No mobile-first UX
- No AI automation (50-65% workflows automatable)

### Your Assets

- **TAT-licensed entity:** GolfOkay = Tan's company, can sell packages immediately
- **Working agency:** Tan's live customer flow, operational knowledge
- **Transport network:** Investor's concierge business (immediate ancillary revenue)
- **Course relationships:** Existing network to build on

## Part 2: Strategy — Direct Package Sales

### Not Building SaaS for Competitors

**Economics comparison:**
- B2B SaaS approach: $3-4K MRR in 90 days (10 agents × $300/month)
- Direct sales: $15-17K revenue in 90 days (20 packages × ~$800 margin)

**Why direct sales:**
- $1,000/package margin vs $300/month SaaS seat
- Revenue scales with package volume, not seat count
- Path to profitability clear: 75 packages/month = $56-64K revenue
- TAT license operational—can be seller-of-record immediately

### Phase 1: Automate Tan's Operation (Months 0-3)

**Build internal tools (not products to sell):**
- LINE/WhatsApp → CRM capture
- Quote builder with templates + price rules
- Automated booking flow (aggregator APIs + manual desk)
- E-voucher issuance
- Payment links (PromptPay + cards)
- Operations board (driver assignment, course confirmations)

**Goal:** Process 20-30 packages in 90 days with 50-65% workflow automation

**Revenue:** Direct package sales (~$1,000/package margin) + transport ancillaries

### Phase 2: Scale Direct Sales (Months 3-9)

**Increase package volume:**
- Sign 2 aggregator partnerships (200-500 courses inventory)
- Direct course relationships (better rates via volume)
- Consumer marketing (LINE bots, SEO, expat/tourist targeting)

**Target:** 50-100 packages/month by Month 9

**Profitability:** $50K-100K monthly revenue, 40-50% margins

### Phase 3: Selective B2B (Months 9+, If Beneficial)

**Only if it accelerates direct sales:**
- White-label tools for courses (free, for preferred inventory)
- Hotel concierge portals (drive package volume, not SaaS revenue)
- Agent partnerships where they bring qualified demand

**Not building:** SaaS products for competitors

## Part 3: Unit Economics

**Per package:**
- Average package value: ฿100K (~$3,000)
- Commission (15%): ~$450
- Transport margin: ~$200
- Ancillaries: ~$100-200
- **Total margin: ~$750-850/package**

**Targets:**
- 90 days: 20 packages = $15-17K revenue
- Month 9: 75 packages = $56-64K revenue (path to profitability)

**Technology integration:**
- Aggregator APIs (immediate): Golfsavers, GolfThai (200-500 courses)
- Direct course relationships (selective): better rates via volume
- Manual desk: 50-55% courses still phone/LINE (accept reality)
- AI automation: 50-65% workflows (FAQ 85%, simple bookings 65%)

## Part 7: Recommendation

**Opportunity: Real.** 700K golf tourists, ฿100K/trip (historical est.), fragmented market, weak incumbents.

**Strategy: Direct package sales.** Automate Tan's operation, scale volume, reach profitability fast. Not building SaaS for competitors—processing packages yourself.

**Execution: Clear 90-day path.** Automate workflows → process 20-30 packages → $15K-17K revenue → validate unit economics.

**Terms: Defined above.** 35% equity, ฿100K base + profit share (฿200K+/month from Month 3), ฿5M capital, 12-month runway.

**To validate:**
- Tan's current traction (actual metrics)
- Confirmed partnerships (not prospective claims)
- Revenue model clarity

**The path to profitability is packages, not SaaS seats.**

20 packages in 90 days = $15K-17K revenue
75 packages by Month 9 = path to profitability clear
