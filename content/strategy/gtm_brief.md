# GolfOkay Internal GTM Brief

**Strategy:** Automate → Scale Direct → Profit Fast
**Horizon:** 90 days to validation, 12 months to profitability
**Capital:** ฿5M for 12-month runway

---

## One-Sentence Strategy

Automate Tan's existing golf tour operation to process 20-30 packages in 90 days ($15-17K revenue), scale to 75+ packages/month by Month 9 ($56-64K revenue), reach profitability through direct package sales—not building SaaS for competitors.

---

## Market Context

- 700K golf tourists visit Thailand annually, spending ~฿100K per trip
- 60-70% of bookings handled by agents via manual workflows (phone/LINE/email)
- Only 15-20% of courses have modern APIs; majority still manual
- Incumbents (Club Thailand Card, Golfasian, GolfNow) have weak digital offerings
- **GolfOkay = Tan's TAT-licensed company:** Can sell packages as seller-of-record immediately

---

## Why Direct Sales (Not B2B SaaS)

**Economics:**
- B2B SaaS: $3-4K MRR (10 agents × $300/month)
- Direct sales: $15-17K revenue (20 packages × ~$800 margin)

**Unit economics per package:**
- Package value: ฿100K (~$3,000)
- Commission 15%: ~$450
- Transport margin: ~$200
- Ancillaries: ~$100-200
- **Total margin: ~$750-850**

**Path to profitability:**
- 20 packages in 90 days = $15-17K revenue
- 75 packages/month by Month 9 = $56-64K revenue
- Break-even at ~50-60 packages/month

---

**Phase 3 (Months 9+): Selective B2B (If Beneficial)**
- White-label tools for courses (free, for better inventory)
- Hotel concierge portals (drive volume, not SaaS revenue)

## Critical Questions to Validate

1. Tan's current monthly package volume and revenue?
2. Customer acquisition channels (what's working now)?
3. Confirmed aggregator/course partnerships (vs prospective)?
4. GolfOkay.co actual metrics (traffic, conversion, bookings)?
5. How does platform revenue integrate with existing operations?

---

## Success Criteria

**Quarter 1 (Month 3):** 15+ packages processed, unit economics validated, automation working

**Quarter 2 (Month 6):** 30+ packages/month sustained, aggregators live, team operational

**Quarter 3 (Month 9):** 60+ packages/month, revenue covering 40%+ costs, path to profitability documented

**Month 12:** Break-even or clear runway extension based on proven traction

---

## Why This Works

- TAT license active → no regulatory blockers
- Direct sales economics superior to SaaS ($1,000/package vs $300/month)
- Hybrid integration accepts market reality (50-55% courses manual)
- Fast path to validation (20-30 packages in 90 days)
