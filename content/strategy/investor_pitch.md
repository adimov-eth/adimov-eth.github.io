# GolfOkay Strategic Framework

**Automate → Scale Direct → Profit Fast**

---

## Market Opportunity

### Key Metrics

- **700K** Golf tourists annually
- **~฿100K** Spend per trip (3x average tourist)
- **~300** Golf courses (150-200 international)

**Distribution reality:** 60-70% bookings via agents using phone/LINE/email. Only 15-20% of courses have modern APIs. Fragmented, manual workflows dominate.

**Competitor weakness:** Club Thailand Card (15K members, legacy UX), Golfasian (192K customers, email-only), GolfNow (weak local penetration). No unified platform with real-time booking + transport + accommodation.

---

## Current State: Licensed & Operational

**GolfOkay = Tan's TAT-licensed company.** Can sell packages immediately as seller-of-record. Thai entity structure complete.

**Infrastructure ready:**
- PromptPay: 81M users, 0.8-1.5% fees vs 3%+ cards
- Digital wallets: 22% of POS transactions
- Visa expansion: 93 countries, 60-day stays (doubled from 30-day)
- Investor's transport/concierge network (immediate ancillary revenue)

**Current operation:** Tan processes packages manually (LINE inquiries → quote → booking → confirmation). Limited by manual capacity, not demand or license status.

---

## Strategy: Direct Package Sales

**Not building SaaS for competitors.** Building automation to scale Tan's direct package sales. $1,000/package margin vs $300/month SaaS seat. Path to profitability is packages, not software licensing.

### Phase 1 – Automate Tan's Operation (Months 0-3)

**Build internal tools (not products to sell):**
- LINE/WhatsApp → CRM capture
- Quote builder with templates + price rules
- Automated booking flow (aggregator APIs + manual desk)
- E-voucher issuance
- Payment links (PromptPay + cards)
- Operations board (driver assignment, course confirmations)

**Goal:** Process 20-30 packages in 90 days with 50-65% workflow automation.

**Revenue:** Direct package sales (~$1,000/package margin) + transport ancillaries.

### Phase 2 – Scale Direct Sales (Months 3-9)

**Increase package volume:**
- Sign 2 aggregator partnerships (immediate inventory: 200-500 courses)
- Direct course relationships (better rates via volume commitments)
- Consumer marketing (LINE bots, SEO, targeted ads to expat/tourist segments)

**Target:** 50-100 packages/month by Month 9

**Profitability:** $50K-100K monthly revenue with 40-50% margins

### Phase 3 – Selective B2B (Months 9+, If Beneficial)

**Only if it accelerates direct sales:**
- White-label tools for courses (free, in exchange for preferred inventory)
- Hotel concierge portals (drive package volume, not SaaS revenue)
- Agent partnerships where they bring qualified demand

## Unit Economics

### Per Package Margin

- **Average package value:** ฿100K (~$3,000)
- **Commission (15%):** ~$450
- **Transport margin:** ~$200
- **Ancillaries:** ~$100-200
- **Total margin: ~$750-850/package**

### Revenue Targets

- **$15-17K** 90-day revenue target (20 packages)
- **$56-64K** Month 9 revenue (75 packages)

**Compare:** Direct sales approach ($15-17K in 90 days) vs B2B SaaS approach ($3-4K MRR).
