# TAT License

Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) license required to operate as tour operator or travel agent in Thailand.

## GolfOkay Status

**✓ ACTIVE AND OPERATIONAL**

Tan's company has TAT license. No regulatory blockers to processing packages from day 1.

## What It Allows

**Sell travel packages:** Act as seller-of-record for golf + transport + accommodation bundles

**Accept payments:** Directly from customers (not as intermediary/referral)

**Issue bookings:** Confirmations and [[e_vouchers|e-vouchers]] in company name

**Operate transport:** For tourist purposes (airport pickup, course transfers, etc.)

**Work with suppliers:** Negotiate directly with courses, hotels, transport providers

## Why This Changed Everything

**Original assumption (WRONG):** Docs initially assumed license needed to be applied for. Built entire B2B-first SaaS strategy around "can't process packages until license approved."

**Reality:** License already active. Can sell packages immediately.

**Strategic pivot:** From "sell SaaS to agents while waiting for license" → "sell packages directly, capture full [[commission_model|commission margin]]"

**Economics impact:**
- B2B SaaS: $300/month/agent × 10 agents = $3K MRR in 90 days
- Direct packages: ~$800 margin × 20 packages = $16K revenue in 90 days

**TAT license being active = direct package sales from day 1 = 5x faster revenue**

## License Requirements (General)

**Ownership structure:**
- 51% Thai nationals (majority)
- Thai managing director required
- Minimum 2 Thai directors on board

**Deposits:**
- Domestic: ฿50,000
- Inbound (foreign tourists): ฿100,000
- Outbound (Thai tourists abroad): ฿200,000

**Office:**
- Physical location required
- Lease ≥2 years
- Address registered with TAT

**Processing time:**
- Application: 60 days typical
- Cannot operate until approved
- Fines for unlicensed operation: ฿100K-500K

**Renewal:** Annual, requires proof of insurance + updated business docs

## GolfOkay's License Scope

**Inbound license:** Confirmed (handles foreign tourists coming to Thailand for golf)

**What this covers:**
- Korean, Japanese, Malaysian, Singaporean, Chinese tourists
- Expats living in Thailand (treated as inbound for tour purposes)
- Package tours including golf, transport, accommodation, activities

**Outbound license:** TBD (would need ฿200K deposit if offering Thai golfers trips to Vietnam/Malaysia)

**Domestic license:** Likely have it (฿50K deposit) for Thai citizen packages

## Compliance Requirements

**Insurance:** Liability insurance covering tourist activities (golf, transport)

**Record keeping:** Customer contracts, booking confirmations, payment records (7 years)

**Safety standards:** Transport vehicles must meet DOT requirements

**Tax reporting:** VAT (7%), withholding tax on supplier payments

**Consumer protection:** Refund policy, cancellation terms must comply with Thai consumer law

## Operational Flexibility

**Revenue model:** License allows direct commission from courses + markup on packages

**Payment handling:** Can accept [[promptpay|PromptPay]], credit cards, bank transfers directly

**Subcontracting:** Can work with [[aggregator_apis|aggregators]] as inventory sources while being seller-of-record

**Partnership structure:** Investor's transport network operates under same license umbrella

## Risks & Limitations

**Regulatory changes:** TAT can revoke license if compliance issues found

**Ownership lock:** 51% Thai ownership requirement can't be circumvented (preference shares don't change legal control)

**Geographic scope:** License valid for Thailand operations only (outbound requires separate license)

**Activity restrictions:** License may not cover all activities (e.g., adventure sports, diving) – need to verify scope

## Competitive Context

**Golfasian:** Has full inbound license, 22+ years operation

**Golfsavers:** Operates as booking platform, courses are sellers-of-record (different model)

**Club Thailand Card:** Membership program, not tour operator (different regulatory category)

**GolfOkay advantage:** Licensed + tech platform + operational flexibility = can do both direct packages AND tech-enabled booking
