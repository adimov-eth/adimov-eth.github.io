# CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score)

Post-trip customer satisfaction rating. Leading indicator of retention, referrals, and long-term viability.

## Target: ≥4.6/5

**Why 4.6:** Industry benchmark for "excellent" travel service. Above this = strong word-of-mouth growth.

**Scale:**
- 5 = Excellent (exceeded expectations)
- 4 = Good (met expectations)
- 3 = Okay (acceptable but not impressive)
- 2 = Poor (didn't meet expectations)
- 1 = Terrible (actively unhappy)

**Month 3 milestone:** CSAT ≥4.6/5 proves product-market fit, not just early traction.

## How Measured

**Survey sent:** 24-48hr after final round played

**Delivery:** LINE message (quick reply buttons for rating)

**Questions:**
1. **Overall experience:** 1-5 scale
2. **Booking ease:** "How easy was it to book?" (1-5)
3. **Course quality:** "Were the courses as described?" (1-5)
4. **Transport (if used):** "How was the transport service?" (1-5)
5. **Value for money:** "Was it worth the price?" (1-5)
6. **Open feedback:** "Anything we could improve?"

**CSAT = Average of Question 1** (overall experience)

**NPS (Net Promoter Score) = separate question:** "Would you recommend GolfOkay to a friend?" (0-10 scale, calculate promoters - detractors)

## Why CSAT Matters

### Retention (Repeat Booking Rate)

**Data from travel industry:**
- CSAT 4.5-5.0: 60-70% book again within 6 months
- CSAT 4.0-4.4: 30-40% book again
- CSAT <4.0: 10-20% book again

**GolfOkay repeat customer value:**
- First booking: ฿25K margin
- Repeat booking (6 months later): ฿25K margin
- CAC for repeat customer: ฿0 (no acquisition cost)
- **Repeat customers = 2x LTV at 0 marginal cost**

**Maintaining CSAT ≥4.6 = 65% retention = strong unit economics**

### Referrals (Word-of-Mouth Growth)

**CSAT 5.0:** Customer actively tells friends ("You HAVE to use GolfOkay!")

**CSAT 4.5-4.9:** Customer recommends if asked

**CSAT 4.0-4.4:** Customer unlikely to recommend (neutral)

**CSAT <4.0:** Customer actively warns others (negative word-of-mouth)

**Referral rates:**
- CSAT 5.0: 40-50% refer ≥1 friend
- CSAT 4.5-4.9: 20-30% refer
- CSAT 4.0-4.4: 5-10% refer
- CSAT <4.0: 0% (negative referrals)

**GolfOkay growth model relies on referrals:**
- Expat community is tight-knit (Bangkok, Pattaya, Chiang Mai)
- Golfers talk about courses, deals, experiences
- If CSAT high → organic growth via WhatsApp groups, LINE groups, expat forums

### Brand Reputation (Online Reviews)

**CSAT correlates with review behavior:**
- CSAT 5.0: 30-40% leave positive review (Google, TripAdvisor, Facebook)
- CSAT 4.5-4.9: 10-20% leave review
- CSAT 4.0-4.4: 5% leave review
- CSAT <4.0: 40-50% leave negative review (motivated by complaint)

**Online reviews matter for acquisition:**
- Potential customers search "golf booking Thailand"
- See GolfOkay with 4.8/5 rating (50+ reviews) vs competitor with 4.2/5 (20 reviews)
- Higher rating = higher conversion

## Drivers of CSAT

### 1. [[sla|Response Time]] (Quote & Confirmation)

**Correlation:**
- <12hr quote time: 4.7/5 CSAT avg
- 12-24hr quote time: 4.4/5 CSAT avg
- >24hr quote time: 3.9/5 CSAT avg

**Why:** Fast response = "they're on top of things" perception. Slow = anxiety and doubt.

**Action:** Hit [[sla|<24hr quote SLA]] consistently.

### 2. Course Quality (Expectations vs Reality)

**Problem:** Customer books based on photos/description. Arrives and course is worse than expected.

**Impact:** Immediate CSAT drop to 3.0-3.5 even if booking process perfect.

**Solution:**
- Accurate course descriptions (don't oversell)
- Recent photos (not 10-year-old promo shots)
- Honest condition reports ("Note: Course doing green renovation, may see some work")
- Set expectations ("Budget course, not championship level")

**Better to under-promise and over-deliver than vice versa.**

### 3. Communication Quality

**High CSAT drivers:**
- Proactive updates ("Your driver will arrive at 6:30am tomorrow")
- Clear [[e_vouchers|e-vouchers]] (no confusion at course)
- Responsive support (reply to LINE messages within 2-4hr)

**Low CSAT drivers:**
- Customer shows up, course has no record (e-voucher not sent to course)
- Driver late, customer missed tee time (no communication)
- Customer confused about what's included (unclear package details)

**Action:** Over-communicate. Send confirmation 24hr before, driver contact details, course contact info.

### 4. Problem Resolution

**Reality:** Things go wrong. Course double-booked, driver flat tire, weather cancellation.

**CSAT impact depends on response:**
- Problem + fast resolution: CSAT 4.5+ ("They fixed it quickly")
- Problem + slow resolution: CSAT 3.5-4.0 ("It got resolved eventually")
- Problem + no resolution: CSAT 1.0-2.0 ("They left me hanging")

**Action:** Empower [[manual_desk]] operators to fix issues immediately:
- Alternative course at same price (if original course cancels)
- Backup driver dispatched (if primary driver unavailable)
- Partial refund / credit for next booking (if issue not fixable)

**Show customer you care more about solving problem than avoiding blame.**

### 5. Value for Money Perception

**Not about being cheapest.** About customer feeling they got fair value.

**High value perception:**
- Price matches quality (great course = premium price okay)
- Included extras (free water in transport, caddy tip pre-paid)
- Smooth experience (no hidden fees, no surprises)

**Low value perception:**
- Price higher than expected (hidden fees revealed at payment)
- Course disappointing for price paid (overpromised)
- Better deal found elsewhere after booking (price transparency issue)

**Action:** Transparent pricing up-front. No hidden fees. If course disappoints, offer credit for next booking.

## CSAT by Customer Segment

### International Tourists (Expected: 4.5-4.8/5)

**High satisfaction drivers:**
- No language barrier (English support)
- Hassle-free (transport, courses, everything handled)
- Value vs home country (Thailand cheaper than Japan/Korea)

**Risks:**
- Cultural misunderstandings (Thai course etiquette different)
- Transport delays (Bangkok traffic)
- Weather (monsoon season cancellations)

### Expats (Expected: 4.6-5.0/5)

**High satisfaction drivers:**
- Convenience (don't need to call courses themselves)
- Access to courses they didn't know about (local knowledge)
- Repeat customer relationship (remember preferences)

**Risks:**
- Price sensitivity (locals know what "should" cost)
- Comparison shopping (can easily check competitor rates)
- High expectations (familiar with Thailand, less forgiving)

### Corporate Groups (Expected: 4.7-5.0/5)

**High satisfaction drivers:**
- Stress-free logistics (company organizer doesn't want headaches)
- Professional service (reflects well on organizer)
- Custom packages (special requests accommodated)

**Risks:**
- Coordination complexity (12 people, varying skill levels, schedule changes)
- Higher stakes (if fails, organizer looks bad to boss/colleagues)

## CSAT Recovery Strategies

### If CSAT drops below 4.5:

1. **Identify root cause:** Which question dragged down score? (booking, course, transport?)
2. **Segment analysis:** Which customer type unhappy? (tourists vs expats vs corporate)
3. **Fix systemic issues:** If transport rated low across 10 customers → transport problem, not isolated
4. **Follow-up with detractors:** Call customers who rated 3.0 or below, ask what happened, offer credit

### If CSAT between 4.5-4.6:

1. **Close to target, need fine-tuning**
2. **Look for "4" ratings (good but not excellent):** What would make it 5?
3. **Add small touches:** Free upgrade, caddy tip included, airport lounge voucher
4. **Improve communication:** More proactive updates

### If CSAT ≥4.7:

1. **Doing well, maintain quality**
2. **Ask for referrals:** "Glad you enjoyed! Mind referring a friend?"
3. **Request review:** "Would you share your experience on Google?"
4. **Learn what's working:** Which courses, which operators, which packages getting 5.0s?

## Month 3 CSAT Milestones

**Target:** ≥4.6/5 average across 20+ completed packages

**Breakdown target:**
- Booking ease: 4.7/5
- Course quality: 4.5/5 (lowest - depends on course not platform)
- Transport: 4.8/5 (if used)
- Value for money: 4.6/5
- Overall experience: 4.6/5

**Response rate target:** 60%+ (12+ responses out of 20 customers)

**If CSAT met:** Product-market fit validated. Can scale volume confidently.

**If CSAT missed:** Operational issues need fixing before scaling (don't grow broken process).

## Competitive Context

**Golfasian:** No public CSAT data, but reviews show 4.2-4.5/5 avg (slow response times hurt score)

**Golfsavers:** 4.0-4.3/5 (limited inventory, no transport, no support)

**Club Thailand Card:** 3.8-4.0/5 (opaque pricing, poor digital experience)

**GolfOkay target 4.6/5+ = differentiation.** Not just cheaper or faster, but better overall experience.
