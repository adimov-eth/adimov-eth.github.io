# Transport Attach Rate

Percentage of golf packages that include transport services. Key driver of ancillary revenue.

## Target: ≥40%

**Why 40%:** Conservative estimate. Competitor data shows 35-50% of golf tourists book transport.

**Revenue impact:** ~$200 margin per package with transport. At 75 packages/month × 40% = 30 packages with transport = $6K/month additional revenue.

## Customer Segments & Attach Likelihood

### High Attach (60-70%)

**International tourists:**
- Don't have car
- Unfamiliar with Thai roads
- Want hassle-free experience
- Will pay premium for convenience

**Example:** Korean golfer, 5-day trip, 3 rounds at different courses.
- Airport pickup: ฿1,200
- Hotel ↔ courses (3× round-trip): ฿4,500
- Final hotel → airport: ฿1,200
- Total: ฿6,900 ($200)

**Attach rate:** 65-75% (very likely to book transport)

### Medium Attach (30-40%)

**Expats without car:**
- Live in Bangkok/Pattaya
- Familiar with area but don't drive
- Mix of Grab + package transport

**Example:** Singapore expat, plays 2 rounds/month.
- Sometimes books transport via package
- Sometimes takes Grab (cheaper but less convenient)

**Attach rate:** 30-40% (situational)

### Low Attach (5-15%)

**Expats with car:**
- Own vehicle
- Familiar with routes
- Only book transport for group trips or drinking rounds

**Local Thai golfers:**
- Drive themselves
- Only need transport for airport trips if traveling to other regions

**Attach rate:** 5-15% (rare)

## Revenue Breakdown

**Cost structure (Investor's transport network):**
- Driver + vehicle: ฿1,500/day
- Fuel: ฿300-500/day
- Total: ฿1,800-2,000/day

**Pricing to customer:**
- Airport pickup: ฿1,200 (1 trip)
- Course transfer round-trip: ฿1,500 (one course, one day)
- Multi-day package (4 rounds, airport pickup/drop-off): ฿8,000-9,000

**Margin:**
- Package cost: ฿6,500-7,000 (4 days × ฿1,600-1,750/day)
- Package price: ฿8,500-9,000
- Margin: ฿2,000-2,500 per package (~$60-75)

**Blended margin (40% attach rate):**
- 75 packages/month × 40% = 30 packages with transport
- 30 × $70 = $2,100/month
- Annual: ~$25K transport margin

## How to Increase Attach Rate

### 1. Default Transport in Package Pricing

**Instead of:**
- Golf package: ฿95,000
- Transport (optional add-on): +฿8,500

**Do:**
- Complete package (golf + transport): ฿100,000
- Golf only (you arrange transport): ฿93,000

**Psychology:** Customers see transport-included as default. Removing it requires opting out (friction).

**Result:** Attach rate increases from 30-35% → 45-55%

### 2. Highlight Convenience Value

**Messaging:**
- "Driver meets you at airport with your name sign"
- "No Grab surge pricing, no taxi negotiations"
- "Multilingual drivers (English, Thai, basic Japanese/Korean)"
- "Stores golf clubs in vehicle between rounds (no hotel storage)"
- "Free bottled water, phone charging cables"

**Not about price.** About eliminating hassle.

### 3. Bundle Discounts

**Standalone pricing:**
- Airport pickup: ฿1,500
- Course transfer: ฿1,800 each × 4 = ฿7,200
- Total if booked separately: ฿8,700

**Bundle pricing:**
- Complete transport package: ฿7,500 (save ฿1,200)

**Why it works:** Customer feels they're getting deal. GolfOkay still makes margin (cost is ฿6,500).

### 4. Corporate/Group Incentives

**Groups of 8-12 players:**
- Van transport: ฿12,000-15,000 (3 days)
- Per person: ฿1,000-1,250
- Much cheaper than individual Grab rides (฿1,500-2,000 per person)

**Attach rate for groups:** 75-85% (logistics nightmare without coordinated transport)

## Competitive Advantage

**Investor operates transport/concierge network:**
- Fleet of vehicles (sedans, vans, minibuses)
- Drivers speak English + Thai
- Insurance and DOT licensing compliant
- **At-cost pricing to GolfOkay** (margin goes to platform, not transport operator)

**Competitors:**
- Golfasian: Outsources transport (marks up 20-30%)
- Golfsavers: No transport services
- Club Thailand Card: No transport services

**GolfOkay differentiation:** Seamless booking (golf + transport in one transaction), better margins due to vertical integration.

## Operational Logistics

**Booking flow:**
1. Customer confirms golf package
2. System prompts: "Add transport? Airport pickup + 3 course transfers: ฿7,500"
3. Customer accepts
4. Driver assigned automatically
5. Customer receives driver contact (LINE ID, phone) 24hr before arrival
6. Driver gets itinerary (airport time, hotel address, course locations, tee times)

**Coordination:**
- Manual desk operator assigns drivers
- Driver confirms pickup times via LINE
- Customer can message driver directly (flexibility for delays)

**Efficiency:**
- One driver can handle 2-3 customers/day if schedules align
- Morning golfers (6-8am tee times): Driver does airport pickup, then course transfer
- Afternoon golfers: Driver does course transfer, then airport drop-off

## Metrics to Track

**Overall attach rate:** % of packages including transport

**By customer segment:**
- International tourists: Target 65%+
- Expats without car: Target 35%+
- Expats with car: Target 10%+

**By package type:**
- Multi-day (3+ rounds): Target 70%+
- Single round: Target 20%+
- Corporate groups: Target 80%+

**Revenue per package (blended):**
- With transport: ฿33,000 margin (golf ฿25K + transport ฿8K)
- Without transport: ฿25,000 margin
- Blended (40% attach): ฿28,200 margin

## Seasonality

**High season (Nov-Mar):**
- More international tourists (higher attach rate)
- Transport prices can increase 10-15% (demand)
- Expected attach rate: 45-50%

**Low season (Apr-Oct):**
- More local/expat play (lower attach rate)
- Transport promotions (free airport pickup with 3+ rounds)
- Expected attach rate: 30-35%

**Blended annual:** 40% realistic target

## Path to Scale

**Month 0-3:** Investor's existing fleet (5-7 vehicles) handles 20-30 packages

**Month 4-6:** Add 2-3 vehicles if needed (฿50-80K/month lease + driver)

**Month 7-12:** 10-12 vehicle fleet, can handle 100-120 packages/month with transport

**Constraint:** Transport scales with capital (vehicles) + hiring (drivers). Not purely software leverage.

**Solution:** Partner with other transport providers in Chiang Mai, Phuket, Hua Hin (markets where Investor doesn't have fleet yet)
