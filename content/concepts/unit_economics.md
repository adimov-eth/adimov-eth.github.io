# Unit Economics

**Core question:** How much do we make per package?

---

## Per-Package Margin Breakdown

**Average package value:** ฿100K (~$3,000)

**Revenue sources:**
- Golf commission (15%): ~$450
- Transport margin: ~$200
- Ancillaries (VIP fast-track, equipment, insurance): ~$100-200

**Total margin per package: ~$750-850**

---

## Revenue Targets

### 90 Days (Validation)
- **Volume:** 20 packages
- **Revenue:** $15K-17K
- **Proof:** Unit economics validated with real data

### Month 9 (Profitability Path)
- **Volume:** 75 packages/month
- **Revenue:** $56-64K/month
- **Margins:** 40-50%
- **Break-even:** 50-60 packages/month

---

## Why This Beats SaaS

**Economics comparison:**
- B2B SaaS approach: $3-4K MRR in 90 days (10 agents × $300/month)
- Direct sales approach: $15-17K revenue in 90 days (20 packages × ~$800 margin)

**Path to profitability:**
- SaaS: Need 50-60 seats at $300/month = $15-18K MRR
- Direct: Need 50-60 packages/month = $37-51K revenue

**Revenue scaling:**
- SaaS: Scales with seat count (limited by agent market size)
- Direct: Scales with package volume (limited only by supply & demand)

**Why not SaaS for competitors:**
- $1,000/package margin >> $300/month SaaS seat
- Revenue scales with package volume, not seat count
- [[tat_license|TAT license]] operational—can be seller-of-record immediately
- Agents would use our tools to train their future competitor

## Margin Sensitivity

**Transport attach rate impact:**
- No transport: ~$550 margin (commission + ancillaries)
- With transport: ~$750 margin (commission + transport + ancillaries)
- 40% attach rate on 75 packages = 30 with transport = +$6K/month

**Commission variation:**
- 12% commission: ~$360 (low-end courses)
- 15% commission: ~$450 (standard)
- 20% commission: ~$600 (premium courses)

**Package value variation:**
- ฿50K package (~$1,500): ~$400 margin
- ฿100K package (~$3,000): ~$800 margin
- ฿150K package (~$4,500): ~$1,200 margin

## Cost Structure

**Variable costs per package:**
- [[aggregator_apis|Aggregator commission]]: If using Golfsavers/GolfThai (exact % TBD)
- [[manual_desk]] staff time: ~฿200-300 per manual booking (15-20 min @ ฿50/hr loaded cost)
- Payment processing: 0.8-1.5% ([[promptpay|PromptPay]]) or 3%+ (cards)
- [[e_vouchers|E-voucher]] generation: Negligible (automated)

**Fixed costs (monthly):**
- Salaries: ฿200K (CTO + Tan base, months 0-3)
- Team: ฿80K (ops manager ฿30K + developer ฿50K from month 2)
- Infrastructure: ~฿10K (servers, tools, APIs)
- **Total fixed:** ฿290K/month base

**Break-even calculation:**
- Fixed costs: ฿290K/month (~$8.7K)
- Average margin: ~$800/package
- Break-even: ~11 packages/month (covers fixed only)
- **Profit target:** 50-60 packages/month = $40-48K revenue - $8.7K fixed = $31-39K profit

---

## Path to Profitability

**Month 3 (Validation):**
- 15+ packages through system
- ฿20K+ average margin/package validated
- Unit economics confirmed with real data

**Month 6 (Scaling):**
- 30+ packages/month sustained
- Revenue: ~$24K/month
- Fixed costs: ~฿290K (~$8.7K)
- **Net:** ~$15K/month profit

**Month 9 (Profitability):**
- 60+ packages/month
- Revenue: ~$48K/month
- Fixed costs: ~฿290K (~$8.7K)
- **Net:** ~$39K/month profit
- Revenue covering ≥40% operating costs confirmed

---

## Risks to Unit Economics

**Downside scenarios:**
- Aggregator fees higher than expected (need direct course relationships)
- [[transport_attach_rate|Transport attach]] below 40% (ancillary revenue drops)
- Commission rates compressed by competition (need volume to compensate)
- Package values skew lower (need higher volume or premium positioning)

**Mitigation:**
- Validate with first 5-10 packages (weeks 3-6)
- Build direct course relationships for better margins
- Increase transport attach through bundling
- Mix of package values (budget + premium)
