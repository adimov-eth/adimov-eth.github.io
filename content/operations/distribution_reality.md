# Distribution Reality

**The market as it exists, not as we wish it existed.**

---

## Current Distribution (2025)

**60-70% of golf bookings in Thailand handled by agents via manual workflows:**
- Phone calls to courses
- LINE chat confirmations
- Email back-and-forth
- Spreadsheets for tracking
- Manual payment collection

**Only 15-20% of courses have modern API-ready systems:**
- POS systems with booking APIs (Golfmanager, Lightspeed)
- Online booking widgets
- Real-time inventory management
- Automated confirmation emails

**50-55% of courses are fully manual:**
- Accept reservations only via phone or LINE
- No booking software (paper logbooks or basic Excel)
- No website or booking widget
- Staff manually checks availability and confirms

**Fragmented, inefficient processes dominate the market.**

---

## Why This Reality Exists

### Course Economics
- Small/medium courses can't justify ฿50-100K/year for booking software
- Low tech literacy among older course managers
- "Phone works fine" mentality (if it ain't broke...)
- Revenue doesn't justify investment

### Agent Incentives
- Agents profit from information asymmetry (opaque pricing)
- Manual process creates switching costs (relationship-based)
- No incentive to push courses toward self-service tech
- Commission model rewards volume, not efficiency

### Infrastructure Lag
- Thailand golf industry hasn't digitized like hotels/flights
- No dominant platform emerged (unlike OpenTable for restaurants)
- International platforms (GolfNow) weak local penetration
- Each course operates independently (no chain standardization)

## Implications for GolfOkay

### Can't Force Digitization
**Rejected approach:** "We'll only work with API-ready courses"
- Loses 50% of inventory
- Misses high-demand legacy courses
- Limits package variety

**Rejected approach:** "We'll force courses to integrate APIs"
- Takes years to convince
- Many will never adopt
- We don't have leverage as new player

### Must Accept Hybrid Reality

**The [[hybrid_integration|hybrid approach]]:**
1. Use [[aggregator_apis|aggregator APIs]] for instant inventory (200-500 courses)
2. Build direct APIs where volume justifies (top 10-15 courses)
3. Staff [[manual_desk|manual desk]] for the 50% that's manual-only

**Not a temporary solution.** Manual desk will exist for years.

### Competitive Advantage Through Acceptance

**While competitors resist reality:**
- GolfNow tries to force API adoption (slow growth)
- Golfasian stays 100% manual (doesn't scale)
- Club Thailand Card ignores courses without tech (limited inventory)

**GolfOkay embraces reality:**
- API where available (speed + automation)
- Manual where necessary (access + inventory)
- Best of both worlds (tech + relationships)

**Result:** Broader inventory, faster launch, better customer experience.

## Distribution by Course Tier

### Premium International Courses (15-20%)
- Modern POS systems (Golfmanager, Lightspeed)
- APIs available
- Online booking widgets
- High green fees (฿3,000-6,000+)
- **GolfOkay approach:** Direct API integration or aggregators

### Mid-Tier Local Favorites (30-35%)
- Basic booking software or Excel
- Some on aggregator platforms (Golfsavers, GolfThai)
- Mix of API and manual
- Medium green fees (฿1,500-3,000)
- **GolfOkay approach:** Aggregators + selective manual desk

### Budget/Local Courses (45-50%)
- Phone/LINE only
- Paper logbooks or simple Excel
- Not on aggregators
- Low green fees (฿500-1,500)
- **GolfOkay approach:** Manual desk (relationship-based)

## Customer Impact

### Current Experience (via traditional agents)
1. Customer messages agent on LINE
2. Agent manually checks notes for course contacts
3. Agent calls/LINE messages multiple courses
4. Waits hours/days for confirmations
5. Agent manually calculates pricing
6. Customer receives email quote
7. Payment via bank transfer or cash
8. Agent emails booking confirmation

**Time:** 1-3 days
**Friction:** High (multiple back-and-forths)
**Transparency:** Low (opaque pricing, manual quotes)

### GolfOkay Experience (hybrid approach)
1. Customer messages GolfOkay LINE bot
2. Bot shows available courses (API + aggregator data)
3. Manual courses routed to [[manual_desk|desk operator]]
4. Operator confirms within <48hr (vs 1-3 days)
5. Customer receives instant quote
6. Payment via [[promptpay|PromptPay]] QR (instant)
7. [[e_vouchers|E-voucher]] sent immediately after confirmation

**Time:** <48hr (vs 1-3 days)
**Friction:** Low (mostly automated)
**Transparency:** High (upfront pricing, instant quotes for API courses)

---

## Evolution Over Time

### Short-term (Months 0-9)
- 50% manual, 50% automated (via aggregators + direct APIs)
- [[manual_desk|Manual desk]] handles ~30-40 bookings/month
- Focus: Scale volume, validate unit economics

### Medium-term (Months 9-18)
- 40% manual, 60% automated (more direct course relationships)
- Some manual courses add APIs as partnership deepens
- Focus: Improve efficiency, reduce manual desk load

### Long-term (18+ months)
- 30% manual, 70% automated (market slowly digitizes)
- GolfOkay becomes incentive for courses to adopt tech
- Focus: Premium courses, complex packages, high-margin segments

**Reality:** Manual desk never goes to zero. Always 20-30% of market stays manual-only.

## Competitor Blind Spots

### GolfNow (API-only strategy)
- Only lists courses with APIs
- Misses 50% of market
- Strong in US/Europe, weak in Thailand

### Golfasian (manual-only strategy)
- 192K customers, but email/phone only
- Doesn't scale (needs more staff for more volume)
- No self-service platform

### Club Thailand Card (legacy courses ignored)
- 15K members, 200+ courses
- Skews toward premium courses with tech
- Budget/local courses not covered

**GolfOkay opportunity:** Be the ONLY platform that serves the entire market (premium + budget, API + manual).

## Data We Need

**To validate distribution assumptions:**
- [ ] Which specific courses have APIs? (get list from aggregators)
- [ ] Which top 20 courses (by volume) are manual? (prioritize for direct relationships)
- [ ] What % of Tan's current bookings are manual vs API? (baseline)
- [ ] Average time to confirm manual booking currently? (benchmark to beat)

**To optimize hybrid approach:**
- [ ] Which aggregators have best course coverage?
- [ ] What are aggregator commission rates?
- [ ] Which manual courses would add API for volume commitment?
- [ ] What's cost per manual booking hour (ops manager time)?
