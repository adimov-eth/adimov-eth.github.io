## GolfOkay Website and Strategic Documents – Data Verification (Oct 2025)

## Key Market Metrics (Verified & Contextualized)

| Metric | Verified Data & Sources | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Annual golf tourists** | The Tourism Authority of Thailand and Asian Golf Industry Federation estimate **~700,000** golf tourists visit Thailand each year [agif.asia](https://agif.asia/2025/01/thailand-tops-asia-tourism-leaderboard/#:~:text=The%20Tourism%20Authority%20of%20Thailand,in%20golf%20during%20their%20stay). | This figure is used consistently across documents and matches 2025 coverage. |
| **Total number of golf courses** | Data on course counts vary by source: an industry overview counted **306 courses** in 2022 (210 in central region, 39 in the north, 31 in the northeast, 26 in the south) [asiagolfjourney.com](https://asiagolfjourney.com/southeast-asias-golf-course-landscape-2025-insights-and-growth/#:~:text=Southeast%20Asia%E2%80%99s%20golf%20course%20scene,in%20golf%20tourism%20and%20infrastructure), while other golf directories list **200–317 courses**. A reasonable range is **≈300 courses**. | Do not present a single precise number without context; use a range. |
| **Average spend per golf trip** | The only available estimate is historical: a 2011 report quoted Mark Siegel (Golfasian) saying golf tourists spend **about ฿100,000 per trip (~US$3,300)** [golfcoursearchitecture.net](https://www.golfcoursearchitecture.net/content/boom-in-thai-golf-tourism#:~:text=The%20value%20of%20foreign%20golf,hit%20US%242%20billion%20in%202012). No recent official data confirm this number; treat it as a *historical benchmark*. | Avoid presenting this as current data. An updated spending survey should be conducted. |
| **Share of bookings via agents** | Industry commentary notes that most bookings are still handled by agents and that major OTAs do not offer real‑time tee‑time booking [agif.asia](https://agif.asia/2025/01/thailand-tops-asia-tourism-leaderboard/#:~:text=The%20Tourism%20Authority%20of%20Thailand,in%20golf%20during%20their%20stay). However, there is *no reliable statistic* confirming "60–70 %". It is safer to state that **"the majority of bookings remain agent‑mediated"**. | Qualitative estimate only. |
| **Courses with modern APIs** | There is no published census of API‑ready courses. Operators note that a **minority of courses offer integrable booking systems**, while many still require phone/LINE/email [agif.asia](https://agif.asia/2025/01/thailand-tops-asia-tourism-leaderboard/#:~:text=The%20Tourism%20Authority%20of%20Thailand,in%20golf%20during%20their%20stay). Avoid quoting "15–20 %" without a source. | Use qualitative language (minority). |
| **Digital payment adoption** | Thailand's PromptPay QR system had **\>81 million registrations** by March 2025 and processed **2.1 billion transactions worth 4.43 trillion THB** in that month [paymentexpert.com](https://paymentexpert.com/2025/06/18/thailand-expands-promptpay-with-mastercard-in-new-deal/#:~:text=PromptPay%20has%20become%20central%20to,year%20increase). Earlier research (2023) reported that digital wallets handled **~22 % of POS transactions and 25 % of e‑commerce volume** [knowledge.antom.com](https://knowledge.antom.com/thailands-payment-market-things-you-may-not-know#:~:text=and%20POS%20transactions,commerce%20transaction%20volume). | Replace generic "22 % of POS" statements with these sourced figures. |
| **Visa‑exempt entry** | As of **March 2025**, nationals from **93 countries** can enter Thailand **visa‑free for up to 60 days** [thaiembassy.com](https://www.thaiembassy.com/thailand-visa/visa-free-period-in-thailand-to-be-changed-again-reduced-to-30-days#:~:text=As%20of%20March%202025%2C%20travelers,were%20limited%20to%2030%20days). This policy, introduced in July 2024, expanded the previous 30‑day exemption and may be subject to future revisions [thaiembassy.com](https://www.thaiembassy.com/thailand-visa/visa-free-period-in-thailand-to-be-changed-again-reduced-to-30-days#:~:text=As%20of%20March%202025%2C%20travelers,were%20limited%20to%2030%20days). | Note the policy may revert to 30 days; check the latest embassy updates before quoting. |
| **Foreign resident base** | Bangkok has **~250,000–300,000** expatriates and Pattaya has **50,000–60,000**, with **3–4 million** foreign residents across Thailand [pattayamail.com](https://www.pattayamail.com/news/expat-population-in-bangkok-and-pattaya-a-growing-hub-for-retirees-professionals-and-digital-nomads-481783#:~:text=countries). | Helps quantify the expat/long‑stay segment mentioned in some documents. |

## Verification of Website Claims & Strategic Documents

### Validated Statements

- **Golf tourism volume (~700k) and market opportunity:** Verified by the Asian Golf Industry Federation article, which reports that the Tourism Authority of Thailand attracts **about 700,000 golf tourists annually** and that **8–9 % of foreign visitors** play golf [agif.asia](https://agif.asia/2025/01/thailand-tops-asia-tourism-leaderboard/#:~:text=The%20Tourism%20Authority%20of%20Thailand,in%20golf%20during%20their%20stay).
- **Visa policy:** Multiple sources (including embassy advisories) confirm that **93 nationalities may stay up to 60 days visa‑free** as of July 2024 [thaiembassy.com](https://www.thaiembassy.com/thailand-visa/visa-free-period-in-thailand-to-be-changed-again-reduced-to-30-days#:~:text=As%20of%20March%202025%2C%20travelers,were%20limited%20to%2030%20days).
- **PromptPay adoption:** PaymentExpert reports **81.06 million PromptPay registrations by March 2025** and **2.1 billion transactions worth 4.43 trillion THB that month** [paymentexpert.com](https://paymentexpert.com/2025/06/18/thailand-expands-promptpay-with-mastercard-in-new-deal/#:~:text=PromptPay%20has%20become%20central%20to,year%20increase), demonstrating that local payment rails can support digital bookings.
- **Incumbent gaps:** Golfasian acknowledges handling **21,000 international golf vacations in 2024** and notes that high demand forces courses to book a year in advance [agif.asia](https://agif.asia/2025/01/thailand-tops-asia-tourism-leaderboard/#:~:text=The%20Tourism%20Authority%20of%20Thailand,in%20golf%20during%20their%20stay). Club Thailand Card's membership base (~15k) and legacy UX are factual, though subjective claims like "zero innovation" should be avoided.

### Statements Requiring Caution or Revision

- **฿86 B market size:** The **86 billion THB** figure widely quoted in documents originates from a **2011–2012** estimate and is not an official 2025 market size. It should be labeled as historical and updated with new data.
- **฿100k spend per trip:** This number is based on a 2011 commentary [golfcoursearchitecture.net](https://www.golfcoursearchitecture.net/content/boom-in-thai-golf-tourism#:~:text=The%20value%20of%20foreign%20golf,hit%20US%242%20billion%20in%202012) and may no longer reflect current spending patterns. Include it as a historical reference only, and note that a 2025 pricing study is needed.
- **Course count and API penetration:** Sources disagree on the number of golf courses (200–317). The documents' exact figures (306 or 300) should be replaced with a range and supported by a citation [asiagolfjourney.com](https://asiagolfjourney.com/southeast-asias-golf-course-landscape-2025-insights-and-growth/#:~:text=Southeast%20Asia%E2%80%99s%20golf%20course%20scene,in%20golf%20tourism%20and%20infrastructure). Likewise, avoid quoting specific API percentages; instead, state that "only a minority of courses have integrable tee‑sheet systems."
- **Agent share (60–70 %):** There is no authoritative statistic; describing bookings as **"primarily agent‑mediated"** is more accurate.
- **Digital wallets 22 % of POS:** This appears to be a global statistic; for Thailand, use the PromptPay data and emphasise rapid QR adoption [paymentexpert.com](https://paymentexpert.com/2025/06/18/thailand-expands-promptpay-with-mastercard-in-new-deal/#:~:text=PromptPay%20has%20become%20central%20to,year%20increase).

## Recommendations for Website & Pitch Revisions

1. **Update market size data:** Remove or clearly label historical figures (฿86 B, ฿100K per trip). Commission a 2024–2025 spending study to provide current estimates.
2. **Use ranges for course counts:** Replace precise "306" or "317" with "around 300" and cite the source that lists 306 courses [asiagolfjourney.com](https://asiagolfjourney.com/southeast-asias-golf-course-landscape-2025-insights-and-growth/#:~:text=Southeast%20Asia%E2%80%99s%20golf%20course%20scene,in%20golf%20tourism%20and%20infrastructure).
3. **Qualify agent and API percentages:** Rephrase to "bookings are predominantly handled by agents" and "only a minority of courses offer API‑based booking."
4. **Cite PromptPay and visa policies:** Highlight the latest numbers for PromptPay registrations [paymentexpert.com](https://paymentexpert.com/2025/06/18/thailand-expands-promptpay-with-mastercard-in-new-deal/#:~:text=PromptPay%20has%20become%20central%20to,year%20increase) and visa‑free entry periods [thaiembassy.com](https://www.thaiembassy.com/thailand-visa/visa-free-period-in-thailand-to-be-changed-again-reduced-to-30-days#:~:text=As%20of%20March%202025%2C%20travelers,were%20limited%20to%2030%20days) to reassure investors about infrastructure readiness and travel ease.
5. **Avoid subjective wording:** Replace judgments like "zero innovation" with factual descriptions ("legacy web UX, no mobile app").
6. **Clarify unverified metrics:** If quoting digital wallet percentages (e.g., 22 % POS), provide a citation or note that it reflects broader Asia/Worldpay trends rather than Thailand‑specific data.
7. **Plan a pricing survey:** The strategy documents rely on historical spending assumptions; conducting a modern pricing study across representative itineraries will validate unit economics.

This verification ensures that investor presentations and public pages reflect accurate, current data and avoid overstating the market or operational assumptions.
