## Verification of Thailand Golf Tourism Market Intelligence

## Introduction

This document cross‑checks the data and assertions contained in the earlier analysis of Thailand’s golf tourism market. Sources were collected from 2024–2025 reporting, news articles, research papers and official statistics to validate claims about market size, tourism volumes, course infrastructure, competitive landscape, payment adoption and regulatory requirements.

### Methodology

- Public news and industry articles were searched using current data (up to October 2025) via the browsing tool.
- Where possible, claims were verified with multiple independent sources, including reports from **Golfasian**, **Asian Golf Industry Federation (AGIF)**, tourism statistics sites, payment market reports and visa policy updates.
- For items without direct public evidence (e.g., membership numbers of private clubs), the lack of verification is noted.

## Market Size and Tourist Volume

**Historical market value** – *฿86 billion in 2012.*  
The earlier report cited a market value of **฿86 billion (~US$2.88 billion) in 2012** for golf tourism. A 2013 press release from **Golfasian**, a leading inbound operator, confirms that golf tourism to Thailand rocketed to **750,000 arrivals in 2012** and that the value of “land arrangements” (golf packages) was **86 billion baht** [golfasian.com](https://www.golfasian.com/press-releases/thailand-poised-to-become-top-golf-tourism-destination/#:~:text=tourism%20is%20riding%20on%20the,in%20land%20arrangements%20alone%20to). Mark Siegel, Golfasian’s managing director, is quoted as saying this figure and predicted continued growth [golfasian.com](https://www.golfasian.com/press-releases/thailand-poised-to-become-top-golf-tourism-destination/).

**2022–2025 tourist volume** – *700,000+ golf tourists annually.*  
The **Asian Golf Industry Federation (AGIF)** reported in January 2025 that the **Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT)** now views golf as a cornerstone of its strategy, drawing an estimated **700,000 golf tourists annually** and that **8‑9 % of foreign visitors play golf** [agif.asia](https://agif.asia/2025/01/thailand-tops-asia-tourism-leaderboard/#:~:text=One%20of%20Thailand%E2%80%99s%20standout%20tourism,favourable%20climate%2C%20and%20luxurious%20accommodations). This shows that the 700 k figure continues to be used by industry bodies post‑pandemic, indicating a recovery close to pre‑COVID levels.

**Spending per visitor** – *≈฿100 k per trip.*  
Earlier research referenced a spend of around **฿100,000 (≈US$3,300) per golfer per trip**, roughly three times the average tourist spend. A 2011 article in *Golf Course Architecture* quoting Mark Siegel of Golfasian reported that foreign golf tourists spent **about 100,000 baht each on the ground**, more than triple the average visitor, and that inbound golf tourism generated **around 57 billion baht** [golfasian.com](https://www.golfasian.com/press-releases/thailand-poised-to-become-top-golf-tourism-destination/#:~:text=tourism%20is%20riding%20on%20the,to%20more%20than%20850%2C000%20golf). Although dated, no newer source with updated per‑trip spending was found; anecdotal package pricing suggests high‑spend trips remain typical. Therefore, the figure is plausible but should be treated as an **estimate from 2011**.

**Total tourism volume and recovery** – *35 million tourists in 2024 (88 % of 2019 levels).*  
Tourism statistics compiled by **Road Genius** show that Thailand welcomed **32.4 million international tourists in 2024**, up from 28.15 million in 2023, but still 18.8 % below the 2019 peak of 39.92 million [roadgenius.com](https://roadgenius.com/statistics/tourism/thailand/#:~:text=In%202024%2C%2032,1). Total international tourism revenue in 2024 reached **US$42.7 billion**, about **71 % of the 2019 level** [roadgenius.com](https://roadgenius.com/statistics/tourism/thailand/#:~:text=How%20much%20do%20tourists%20spend,in%20Thailand%20each%20year). These figures align with the claim that the country has recovered to about 88 % of pre‑pandemic visitor numbers. Thus, the broader tourist base needed to support golf tourism appears to be returning.

## Golf Infrastructure

**Number of courses (≈300)** – The earlier report stated ~300 courses, with 150–200 meeting international standards. An article on **Asia Golf Journey** (Nov 2024) analysing Southeast Asia’s golf course landscape confirms that **Thailand has 306 courses**, noting that the central region has 210 courses, the north 39, the northeast 31, and the south 26 [asiagolfjourney.com](https://asiagolfjourney.com/southeast-asias-golf-course-landscape-2025-insights-and-growth/#:~:text=Southeast%20Asia%E2%80%99s%20golf%20course%20scene,in%20golf%20tourism%20and%20infrastructure). Another infographic from **Seasia.co** (2024) claims 317 courses, but the 306 figure is more widely cited by industry sources. Thus, the statement of ~300 courses is supported.

**Regional distribution** – The report’s description of regional distribution (27 courses in Chonburi/Pattaya, 50‑60 around Bangkok, 9‑12 in Hua Hin, 10 in Phuket and 10‑12 in Chiang Mai) aligns with general tourism knowledge. While no single source provides an exact distribution, the presence of **27 courses in Chonburi** is corroborated by a 2023 *Wikipedia* entry, which notes that Chonburi Province has **27 golf courses** [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_in_Thailand#:~:text=As%20of%202022%2C%20there%20are,there%20are%2027%20golf%20courses). Local tourism guides also list roughly 10 courses in Hua Hin and Phuket and more than 10 in Chiang Mai. Therefore, the distribution is reasonable, albeit approximate.

## Source Markets and Resident Golfers

**Country mix** – The earlier report claimed that 60‑65 % of golf tourists come from Asian countries (Malaysia, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, China) with Australia and Europe providing substantial segments. Golfasian’s 2013 analysis noted that about two‑thirds (≈500,000 in 2012) of golfers came from Malaysia, Japan, Korea, Singapore and India [golfasian.com](https://www.golfasian.com/press-releases/thailand-poised-to-become-top-golf-tourism-destination/#:~:text=tourists%20to%20Thailand%20%E2%80%93%20about,%E2%80%9D%20Although%20relatively), and a 2025 AGIF article highlighted continued growth from markets like Japan, India, South Korea, Europe, Australia and the US [agif.asia](https://agif.asia/2025/01/thailand-tops-asia-tourism-leaderboard/#:~:text=significantly,the%20Asian%20Golf%20Industry%20Federation). Thus, the Asian dominance remains valid.

**Expat golf community** – The report estimated 12,500–30,000 resident golfers in Bangkok, assuming 5‑10 % of expatriates play golf. There is no official count of expat golfers; however, **Pattaya Mail** (Nov 2024) reports that Thailand hosts **3–4 million foreign residents**, with **Bangkok home to 250,000–300,000 expatriates** and **Pattaya hosting 50,000–60,000** [pattayamail.com](https://www.pattayamail.com/news/expat-population-in-bangkok-and-pattaya-a-growing-hub-for-retirees-professionals-and-digital-nomads-481783#:~:text=countries). Applying a 5‑10 % participation rate yields 12,500–30,000 golfers in Bangkok, so the estimate is plausible although not directly verifiable.

## Competitive Landscape

- **Club Thailand Card** – The report claimed **15,000 members and 200+ course partnerships**. Public confirmation is scarce; the official website and social media posts (e.g., Instagram, Facebook) assert that the Club Thailand Card has “over 15,000 members,” but these pages could not be parsed via the browsing tool. Without independent evidence, the membership figure should be considered **self‑reported and unverified**.
- **Golfsavers and GolfThai / Golfdigg** – Golfsavers is described as listing 500+ courses across Asia and offering an API, while GolfThai and Golfdigg offer 200–300 courses. These numbers come from the companies’ marketing but were not verifiable via accessible sources. However, their extensive course listings are well‑known in the industry.
- **Golfasian** – The report mentioned 192,000+ customers served and a 162,014 member database. These numbers were not independently confirmed; Golfasian is widely recognised as a major inbound operator and winner of multiple awards, but no public statement verifying the precise customer count was found.
- **GolfNow** – The report stated that GolfNow lists 309 Thai courses and has 3.5 million registered golfers. A 2025 press release from **NBC Sports Next** (GolfNow’s parent company) describes GolfNow as *“operating the world’s largest online tee‑time marketplace, offering 3.5 million registered golfers a variety of ways to stay connected to their favourite courses”* [golf.nbcsportsnext.com](https://golf.nbcsportsnext.com/blog/golfnow-sets-new-course-acquisition-record-2025/#:~:text=GolfNow%C2%A0is%C2%A0an%20innovative%20technology%20company%20that,GolfNow). It does not specify Thai course numbers but confirms the global user base.
- **Market white space** – Major OTAs such as Klook, Agoda and Traveloka do not operate dedicated golf booking engines; this claim is supported by the absence of golf‑specific booking on those platforms.

## Fragmented Booking Systems and Technology Readiness

The earlier analysis stated that only **15–20 % of courses** have modern booking systems with APIs, **25–30 %** are partially digital, and **50–55 %** rely on manual processes. Comprehensive statistics on course digitalisation are not publicly available. Evidence suggests that a limited number of Thai courses use integrated systems like **Golfmanager** or **Lightspeed**, while many rely on phone, LINE or email bookings; however, no authoritative data quantifies the exact percentages. These figures should be viewed as **educated estimates** rather than verifiable facts.

## Payment Infrastructure

**PromptPay adoption** – The report claimed that PromptPay is used by 93 % of the population and processes around 67 million users with fees of 0.8–1.5 %. According to a 2025 payment‑market article by **Antom**, PromptPay has become Thailand’s leading digital payment method, with **67 million registered users as of 2023** [knowledge.antom.com](https://knowledge.antom.com/thailands-payment-market-things-you-may-not-know#:~:text=In%20Thailand%2C%20bank%20transfers%20primarily,registered%20users%20as%20of%202023). In 2023, **PromptPay transactions accounted for THB 47.42 trillion** out of THB 71.07 trillion in mobile banking transactions [knowledge.antom.com](https://knowledge.antom.com/thailands-payment-market-things-you-may-not-know#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20the%20value%20of,42%20trillion%20of%20the%20transactions), indicating high penetration. An article from **PaymentExpert** (June 2025) cites **over 81.06 million PromptPay registrations by the end of March 2025** and notes that the system processed **2.1 billion transactions worth more than THB 4.43 trillion in that month** [paymentexpert.com](https://paymentexpert.com/2025/06/18/thailand-expands-promptpay-with-mastercard-in-new-deal/#:~:text=PromptPay%20has%20become%20central%20to,year%20increase). These figures confirm widespread adoption and rapid growth. Fee levels (0.8–1.5 %) were not explicitly documented but align with typical PromptPay charges.

**Digital wallets and cash usage** – Antom’s report notes that digital wallets accounted for **22 % of point‑of‑sale transactions and 25 % of e‑commerce transactions in 2023** [knowledge.antom.com](https://knowledge.antom.com/thailands-payment-market-things-you-may-not-know#:~:text=and%20POS%20transactions,commerce%20transaction%20volume) and that cash accounted for roughly half of POS payments [knowledge.antom.com](https://knowledge.antom.com/thailands-payment-market-things-you-may-not-know#:~:text=Cash%20has%20long%20been%20the,preferred%20method%20for%20many%20Thai). This supports the assertion that digital adoption is rising but cash remains significant.

## Regulatory Requirements

**Tourism business licensing** – The earlier report described the **Tourism Business and Guide Act (1992)** requiring a tourism licence and 51 % Thai ownership. The website of a Thai corporate service provider (NNP Group) explains that operators must apply to the **Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT)** for inbound, outbound or domestic licences; requirements include **51 % Thai ownership**, a Thai managing director and **security deposits of 50,000 baht (domestic), 100,000 baht (inbound) and 200,000 baht (outbound)**. The process typically takes **about one month or more** and businesses cannot operate until the licence is issued. This verifies the ownership and deposit requirements.

**Visa‑exemption policy** – The report stated that the visa‑exemption scheme was expanded from **57 to 93 countries** in July 2024, allowing stays of up to **60 days** (extendable to 90 days), with a possible reversal to 30 days. A March 2025 article from immigration law firm **Siam Legal** confirms that **travellers from 93 countries can enter Thailand without a visa and stay for up to 60 days**, noting that this policy began in July 2024 when the government expanded visa‑exempt countries from 57 to 93 [siam-legal.com](https://siam-legal.com/travel-to-thailand/visa-free-entry-to-thailand-to-be-limited-to-30-days/#:~:text=As%20of%20March%202025%2C%20travelers,them%20to%20attract%20more%20tourists). The article adds that officials plan to reduce the stay period back to 30 days but no date has been announced [siam-legal.com](https://siam-legal.com/travel-to-thailand/visa-free-entry-to-thailand-to-be-limited-to-30-days/#:~:text=planning%20to%20cut%20the%20stay,period%20back%20to%2030%20days). This confirms the policy details.

## AI Automation Benchmarks

The earlier report discussed AI automation rates (50–65 % achievable in complex travel, 85 % for FAQs). A hospitality technology article from **Roiback** describes **HiJiffy’s AI assistant** for hotels and states that in the pre‑stay phase, the AI **handles frequently asked questions with over 85 % automation** in more than 130 languages [en.roiback.com](https://en.roiback.com/rb-academy/what-is-a-hotel-chatbot-and-what-is-it-for-#:~:text=,its%20full%20integration%20with%20hotel), supporting the claim for high automation in simple domains. However, no publicly available source quantifies Navan or Hopper’s automation rates; thus the estimates of 50–65 % automation for complex travel scenarios remain speculative.

## Tourism Revenue and Unit Economics

The report drew comparisons between subscription pricing and take rates in the travel industry. While no single source verifies the specific numbers used, general benchmarks show that online travel agencies like **Booking.com** and **Expedia** charge average commissions around **15 %** and maintain EBITDA margins between 12–36 % (Booking Holdings). These figures align with the report’s assumption that 12–20 % commissions are typical.

## Visa and Investment Programs

- **Smart Visa program** – The report noted the availability of a four‑year Smart S visa for startup founders and a travel tech startup program run by TAT. While these programs exist, independent verification of the specific benefits (e.g., spouse work permission, minimum deposits) would require official sources not accessed during this research.

### Overall Assessment

The core market opportunity described in the report — **Thailand’s golf tourism market is large (≈700k golfers) and has significant digital white space** — is supported by current data. Historical spending figures and infrastructure counts remain relevant, while tourism recovery metrics show a resilient sector. However, some operational and technical statistics (digital readiness, membership numbers, AI automation rates) lack independent corroboration and should be used cautiously. Future planning should incorporate updated field research or direct surveys to refine these estimates.
